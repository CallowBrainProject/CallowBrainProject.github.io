My Story 
======

Path to my Interest in Biomedical Research
------
While first majoring in Mechanical Engineering as an undergraduate at the University of Maryland College Park, I worked as a research technician in the Maryland Applied Physics Lab. I gained a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer modeling. Although I was considered a promising engineering student by the end of my first year, I felt everything but successful the next year due to family members' health issues during the summer and the following semester. My grandmother, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease five years prior, was at a stage of memory loss and personality change that required significant health care from my mother and grandfather. Additionally, after drastic lifestyle changes and emotional stress due to my grandmother's health concerns, my mother was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, and my grandfather soon after diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. The situation had also made it painfully clear that I was no longer passionate about mechanical engineering. The one saving grace for me had been "running." I took up running in college and found that it helped me cope with the stress of worrying about and taking care of my family members while allowing me to challenge myself. I also found that running improved both my physical and mental health. This combination of factors led me to switch my major from Mechanical Engineering to Kinesiology in the School of Public Health, which focuses on human physiology, aging, and mental health. I decided to pursue a career in biomedical research. Although my mother and grandparents recently passed during my graduate training, the experience has further motivated me in my chosen field of study and research interests. My long-term goal is to characterize how lifestyle factors, such as exercise, preserve critical age-susceptible brain networks across the lifespan. I hope that by revealing how these networks deteriorate and how lifestyle factors may preserve these crucial systems, we will one day help other families in similar situations to mine understand and further prevent such tragedy.

Graduate Training
======
I am pursuing my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience through Maryland's interdisciplinary Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program (https://nacs.umd.edu/), advised by Dr. Carson Smith (https://sph.umd.edu/people/j-carson-smith). 

Clinical Trail Training
------
During my graduate student training I have worked closely with Dr. Smith to implement and collect data for his R01 (#NCT03727360), which is a clinical trial exploring how exercise training prevents Alzheimer's disease in those at greatest risk (APOE-e4 postitive). Specifically, I have conducted blood draws, performed exercise stress testing, collected MRI scans, and formatted data collection and storage for the grant. 

Neuroimaging Imaging Training
------
While I learned how to analyzed fMRI data as an undergraduate student, coming into graduate school I was interested in developing expertise in new neuroimaging techniques. Thus, I predominantly focused on developing and applying structural and diffusion imaging methods that provide novel information about human brain tissue connectivity and microarchitecture. Specifically, my research interests center around understanding how lifestyle interventions like exercise modify white matter and gray matter microstructural integrity. I have published three first author publications, in which we show hippocampal gray matter diffusion is more predictive of source memory performance than volume in children aged 4-9 yrs old, insular and cerebellar gray diffusivity changes following a 12 week exercise intervention in healthy older adults and individuals with mild cognitive performance was associated with improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and that an acute 30 minute bout of aerobic exercise alters hippocampal microstructure but not hippocampal volume.

NSF Computation and Mathematics for Biological Networks Training Fellow
------
The Computational and Mathematics for Biological Networks program (COMBINE), is a relatively new National Research Training (NRT) funded program at UMD (NSF award number #1632976) that immerses students in interdisciplinary research and training that integrates quantitative modeling methods for processing, analyzing, and visualizing the structural and dynamical principles that govern living systems. I received an offer from COMBINE as an NRT fellow and began the training program in Fall 2020. Program participants receive training in quantitative metrics for biological networks, mechanistic models of biological systems, network statistics and machine learning for biological applications, and visualization techniques for large-scale complex biological data sets. The program includes approximately 8 credits of coursework, several workshops and training opportunities a semester, and ample career development opportunities. The COMBINE program's research culture and enriching, collaborative environment will enhance my exposure to team science. It also provides excellent large scale data analysis skills. I have received NIMH authorization to download and analyze open-source data from the young adult human connectome project and the lifespan aging human connectome project. With my access to Maryland's supercomputer, bswift, I am processing the diffusion and resting state data from the younger and older adult human connectome data sets to determine the relationship between fitness, gray matter microstructure and functional connectivity, and various cognitive measures. So far we have found that fitness preserves white matter and gray matter microstructure in both younger and older adults and that better fitness mediates the negative relationship between age and reduced fluid cogntive performance
